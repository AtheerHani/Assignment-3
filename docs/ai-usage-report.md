## Feature Implementation with AI Assistance

### 1. GitHub API Integration

**Objective:** Fetch and display public repositories with error handling.

**AI Assistance:**
- Generated fetch logic with error handling patterns
- Suggested loading state management and retry button
- Provided error handling for network/HTTP errors

**My Adaptation:**
- Customized username to "AtheerHani"
- Added filtering for public repos
- Implemented UI state updates (loading/error/success)
- Added retry button functionality

**Learning:** Understood fetch API error patterns and async flow control.

### 2. Skill Filtering with Multi-Category System

**Objective:** Filter skills by category (All, UI/Design, Front-End, Back-End).

**AI Assistance:**
- Suggested event listener pattern for buttons
- Provided CSS class toggling for animations
- Helped structure data attributes

**My Adaptation:**
- Correctly categorized: UI/Design (Figma, Canva), Front-End (HTML, CSS, JS), Back-End (Node.js, Python, Java, MongoDB)
- Added smooth fade-in animations
- Enhanced button styling with active states

**Learning:** Understood event handling, DOM manipulation, CSS animations.

### 3. State Persistence with localStorage

**Objective:** Remember user's filter selection across page reloads.

**AI Assistance:**
- Suggested localStorage API pattern
- Provided key-value storage structure
- Helped with state retrieval on load

**My Adaptation:**
- Integrated into filter function
- Applied saved filter on page load
- Ensured updates persist

**Learning:** Understood browser storage and state workflows.

### 4. Contact Form Validation

**AI-Reviewed Feature:** Multi-step validation (empty check → email verification → submit)  
Demonstrates complex conditional logic, state management, error handling.
